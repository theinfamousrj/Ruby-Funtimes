					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>Well, my name is Raymond John Hill, but everyone that knows me calls me RJ.</p>
					<p>I've been attached to computers for longer than I can remember. When I was</p>
					<p>a kid, my favorite game was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egv8ynXMDN0">Chivalry</a> on my Apple II. I also attended a small</p>
					<p>programming class in elementary school. We learned to program in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a></p>
					<p>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>. I remember Logo was my favorite because you could just mess</p>
					<p>around with it and you would sometimes get really fantastic looking images.</p>

  					<h2>What am I?</h2>
					<p>I am a Physics major at the <a href="http://www.westga.edu">University of West Georgia</a>. Two semesters ago</p>
					<p>I finished taking all of the Physics courses that the university offered. Right now</p>
					<p>I'm just floating around the school, taking some courses in computer science</p>
					<p>and anything else that interests me.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>In an effort to add some content, I'll list my favorite courses that I've taken:</p>
					<p>Classical Mechanics, Optics, Nuclear Physics, Solid State Physics, Game Design,</p>
					<p>Software Engineering 1 & 2, and Data Structures and Discrete Math 1 & 2.</p>
					<p>Oh and I almost forgot about Modern Physics!</p>

  					<h2>Why am I?</h2>
					<p>Interesting question! I still don't totally know why I am... I assume it</p>
					<p>has something to do with physics, computers, and education.</p>
